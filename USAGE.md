# Using Signum: A Practical Guide

Welcome to Signum! This guide provides quick steps to help you understand and apply Signum content labels to your work. Our goal is to make transparency about AI involvement simple and consistent.

For the full technical details, definitions, edge cases, and governance, please refer to the complete [Signum Standard Document](docs/STANDARD.md).

## What is Signum? (TL;DR)
* Signum is an open standard providing simple labels and visual indicators to clearly indicate the level of Artificial Intelligence used in creating digital content.

## Why Label Your Content with Signum?
* Builds trust and transparency with your audience.
* Clearly represents your creation process (human-led, AI-assisted, etc.).
* Supports responsible use of AI tools.
* Helps create a clearer information ecosystem.
* May align with emerging platform or regulatory expectations.

## Understanding the Signum Levels (Quick Reference)
* Signum has 5 levels of labelling:

    * **L0: Human (H):** You created the core content yourself without significant generative AI help (spellcheck is fine!). 
    ```
    Example: An article you wrote from scratch, a photo you took.
    ```
    * **L1: Human, AI-Enhanced (H-AE):** You created the core content, but used AI for minor assistance like grammar checks, style suggestions, simple background removal, or basic code autocompletion. 
    ```
    Your blog post edited by an AI grammar tool, your code using Copilot for suggestions.
    ```
    * **L2: AI-Assisted, Human-Reviewed (AI-HR):** AI generated the initial draft or core components, but you heavily edited, fact-checked, restructured, and took responsibility for the final piece. 
    ```
    An AI-drafted report you significantly rewrote and verified.
    ```
    * **L3: AI-Generated, Human-Prompted (AI-HP):** You used AI (like ChatGPT, Midjourney) with a prompt to generate the content, and used the output mostly as-is with minimal changes. 
    ```
     A blog post generated by ChatGPT from your prompt with only minor edits, an AI image used directly.
    ```
    * **L4: Fully Automated AI (AI-FA):** The content was generated automatically by an AI system without a specific prompt from you for this instance. 
    ```
    Automated weather reports, programmatic market summaries.
    ```

## How to Choose the Right Label: A Simple Guide
* We've created an example flow which should help you come to the right label:
    1.  **Did you use generative AI substantively to create the core content?**
        * No -> **Label H**
        * Yes -> Go to Q2
    2.  **Was the AI's role primarily minor assistance on your own core work?** (e.g., grammar, style suggestions, minor image edits)
        * Yes -> **Label H-AE**
        * No (AI generated the core substance) -> Go to Q3
    3.  **Did you significantly review, edit, fact-check, and take responsibility for the AI-generated output?**
        * Yes -> **Label AI-HR**
        * No (Used largely as-is from AI) -> Go to Q4
    4.  **Did you directly prompt the AI for this specific piece of content?**
        * Yes -> **Label AI-HP**
        * No (Generated automatically/programmatically) -> **Label AI-FA**
    * *Add note: When in doubt, refer to the detailed definitions in [STANDARD.md](STANDARD.md#3-signum-label-categories).*

## How to Apply Your Signum Label (Common Methods)
* The method for adding your Signum label depends on the type of content you are labeling. Here are common examples:

    ### Markdown Files (YAML Front Matter - Recommended)
    * Add this block at the very top of your `.md` file.
    * Example:
        ```yaml
        ---
        signum:
          level: H-AE
          version: "1.0.0"
          timestamp: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" # Use current UTC time
          asserter: "uri:your-website-or-profile-url" # Your identifier
        ---
        ```
    * Briefly explain `asserter` (it's you or your site making the claim) and link to the Standard for handle format.

    ### Markdown Files (Visible Text Statement)
    * If YAML isn't suitable, add this near the top of your text.
    * Example:
        `Signum Label (v1.0.0): H-AE. Asserted by [Your Name/Site/Handle] on YYYY-MM-DD.`

    ### Web Pages (HTML Meta Tags)
    * Add these tags inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
    * Example:
        ```html
        <meta name="signum:level" content="H-AE">
        <meta name="signum:version" content="1.0.0">
        <meta name="signum:timestamp" content="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ">
        <meta name="signum:asserter" content="uri:your-website-or-profile-url">
        ```
    * Note on multiple tools (optional): If using multiple tools add `signum:tool` tag with semicolon separated values (e.g. `<meta name="signum:tool" content="Tool A; Tool B">`)

    ### Advanced Methods
    * You can also leverage more advanced methods like JSON-lD, C2PA, and XMP for more complex needs, please read [STANDARD.md Section 5](STANDARD.md#5-technical-specification-metadata-embedding) for more details.

## Visual Labels (Icons)
* Where possible leverage visual labels for your chosen label ([Link to Assets](./assets/icons)).
* Please use the official icons, and follow our best practices where possible:
    * **Opacity** Avoid lowering the opacity where possible.
    * **Positioning** Try to position your icon in a consistent manner, we recommend picking a corner of your content and placing the icon there.
    * **Colour** Avoid using colour, when required please consider WCAG guidelines.

## Handling Mixed Content (The Simple Rule)
* If your content mixes human and AI parts (e.g., human video with AI voiceover), use the label corresponding to the *highest level of AI involvement* used for any significant part.
* Example: Human article (H) + AI-generated image (AI-HP) = Label the whole thing **AI-HP**.

## Updating Labels When Content Changes
* If you significantly edit content later, especially using AI, re-evaluate and update the Signum label and timestamp. See [STANDARD.md Section 4.3](STANDARD.md#43-labeling-modified-content) for details and history tracking.
