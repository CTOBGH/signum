## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
* Signum's purpose is to easily allow content creators to label their content in a repeateable, standardised fashion, that is widely recognised across the internet by its users. Fostering trust, transparency, and consistency is crucial. 

### 1.2 Scope

The Signum Content Labeling Standard is designed to be broadly applicable across various forms of digital media where understanding the level of AI involvement in the creation process is relevant for transparency and trust. The standard can be applied voluntarily by creators or implemented by platforms and distributors.

**Applicable Media Forms Include (but are not limited to):**

* **Text:**
    * Articles (News, Opinion, Informational)
    * Blog Posts & Website Content
    * Social Media Posts & Updates
    * Creative Writing (Stories, Poems, Scripts)
    * Code & Software Documentation
    * Reports & Summaries
    * Marketing & Advertising Copy
    * Educational Materials

* **Visual Media (Images & Video):**
    * Static Images (Photographs, Illustrations, AI-Generated Art, Graphics)
    * Short-Form Video (Social Media Clips, Reels, Stories)
    * Long-Form Video (Documentaries, Films, Vlogs, Presentations)
    * Animated Content
    * User Interface Elements (if generated or significantly modified by AI)
    * Advertisements

* **Audio:**
    * Podcasts & Spoken Word Content
    * Audiobooks & Narrations
    * Music & Sound Effects
    * Voiceovers & Synthesized Speech (e.g., for accessibility, virtual assistants)
    * Audio Tours & Guides

**Explicit Exclusions:**

While the standard aims for broad applicability, the following are generally considered out of scope for mandatory or typical Signum labeling:

* **Private/Personal Communications:** Content intended primarily for direct, private communication between individuals (e.g., personal emails, direct messages/chats) where public transparency is not the primary concern.
* **Ephemeral Content:** Highly transient content not intended for persistence or wide distribution where labeling is impractical (e.g., some real-time status indicators, temporary system messages). *Note: Caution advised, as misinformation can spread via seemingly ephemeral content.*
* **Non-Consumable System Data:** Raw operational data, log files, intermediate computational results, or system outputs not intended as human-consumable content.
* **Underlying Models/Algorithms:** Signum labels apply to the *output* content generated by AI, not the AI models or algorithms themselves.
* **Pre-Existing Content:** Content created and published before the adoption or implementation of this standard (unless retrospectively labeled).

The primary focus of the Signum standard is on content that is published, shared, or otherwise distributed in a context where understanding its provenance is beneficial for the audience or downstream systems.


Okay, let's expand section 1.3 "Goals & Non-Goals" to provide more detail and clarity.
Markdown

### 1.3 Goals & Non-Goals

Understanding the intended purpose and limitations of the Signum standard is crucial for its effective application and interpretation.

**Goals of the Signum Standard:**

* **Enhance Transparency:** To make the origin and primary creation method of content visible and understandable to end-users, platforms, and downstream systems. 

* **Empower Users:**
    * For **Users:** Provide a consistent indicator to help them critically evaluate the nature, and provence of content.
    * For **Creators:** Offer a standardised way to transparently communicate the use of AI (or lack thereof), build trust with their audience, and represent work accurately.
    * For **Platforms:** Supply a framework to build features that promote transparency, manage content responsibly, and foster more trustworthy user environments.

* **Promote Consistency & Interoperability:** Establish a common lexicon and set of categories for describing AI usage, reducing confusion caused by ad-hoc or proprietary labeling methods across different platforms and content types.

* **Support Responsible AI Innovation & Adoption:** Encourage ethical development and deployment of AI in content creation by providing a clear mechanism for disclosure, reduce risks of unintentional disinformation or manipulation.

* **Aid Information Ecosystem Health:** By enabling the identification of AIGC, provide a potential tool for researchers and developers working on challenges like combating large-scale misinformation campaigns or curating datasets to mitigate "model collapse".

* **Foster Media Literacy:** Encourage audiences to consider the source and creation process behind the content they consume, promoting more critical engagement with all digital media.

**Non-Goals of the Signum Standard:**

It is equally important to understand what Signum is *not* intended to do:

* **Not a Judgment of Content Quality:** The Signum label indicates the creation process, *not* whether the content is good, bad, accurate, poorly written, or artistically valuable. High-quality content can exist at all Signum levels, as can low-quality content.

* **Not a Determination of Legality or Copyright:** Signum does not assess whether content infringes copyright, is defamatory, constitutes hate speech, or violates any laws or regulations. Provenance labeling does not confer or negate legal rights or responsibilities associated with the content.

* **Not a Comprehensive Ethical Evaluation:** While transparency itself is an ethical goal, Signum does not evaluate the broader ethical implications of the content's *purpose* or *impact*. Content labeled identically could be used for beneficial or harmful ends.

* **Not an AI Detection Mechanism:** Signum is a *disclosure standard* based on self-attestation, platform policies, and potentially verifiable metadata (like C2PA). It does *not* provide a technical method for automatically detecting whether content was AI-generated. Detection tools may be used in *verification workflows*, but are separate from the standard itself.

* **Not a Guarantee of Factual Accuracy:** While some labels indicate human review (AI-HR), no Signum label guarantees the absolute factual correctness of the content. Accuracy remains separate from provenance.

## 2. Core Definitions

* To ensure a common understanding when applying and interpreting the Signum standard, the following terms are defined:
    
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
    For the purpose of this standard, AI refers specifically to computational systems, particularly machine learning models and Large Language Models, capable of generating novel content (such as text, images, audio, video, or code) that mimics human creativity or output, often based on patterns learned from large datasets. This primarily concerns *generative AI* tools.

* **AI-Generated Content (AIGC):**
    Digital content where the core output, structure, or creative expression was produced by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system. This may be initiated by human prompts but is not fundamentally shaped or validated by substantive human intervention post-generation (corresponds mainly to Signum levels AI-HP and AI-FA).

* **Compound Content:**
    A single piece of digital media composed of multiple distinct elements or media types, where those elements may have different origins or creation methods (e.g., a video incorporating human-filmed segments, AI-generated animation, and licensed human-created music). Section 4.2 provides guidance on labeling such content.

* **Content Provenance:**
    Verifiable information and metadata documenting the origin, creation process, and history of modifications of a piece of digital content. Signum labels are a component of content provenance.

* **Human-Generated Content (HGC):**
    Digital content primarily created through human intellect, skill, creativity, and effort. Generative AI tools are either not used, or their use is limited to non-substantive assistance that does not dictate the core message, structure, or creative expression (corresponds mainly to Signum levels H and H-AE).

* **Signum Label:**
    One of the specific category codes defined by this standard (H, H-AE, AI-HR, AI-HP, AI-FA) assigned to a piece of content to declare the assessed level of AI involvement in its creation according to the Signum standard version specified.

* **Substantive Contribution:**
    An action, input, or modification during the content creation process that fundamentally shapes the core message, creative expression, factual claims, or essential structure of the final output. Actions like correcting spelling/grammar, applying basic image filters, or using standard non-generative software tools are typically considered non-substantive in this context. The distinction between substantive and non-substantive AI contribution is key to differentiating between Signum levels (e.g., H vs H-AE, H-AE vs AI-HR). Further clarification is provided within the category definitions (Section 3).

    * *(Add others as needed)*

## 3. Signum Label Categories

### 3.1 Overview
* Signum utilise 5 levels of labelling to distinguish content, below are the levels and their purpose.

### 3.2 Level 0: Human (H)
* **Definition:** Content created primarily through human intellect and effort without substantive use of generative AI tools for the core creation.
* **Criteria:** Human generated content with no AI assisted tooling.
* **Examples:** Manually written articles, human-shot photographs, hand-coded software (using non-AI tools).
* **Clarifications:** Use of spellcheck, grammar tools, basic photo filters, standard programming libraries does not disqualify.

### 3.3 Level 1: Human, AI-Enhanced (H-AE)
* **Definition:** Human-created content with support from generative AI tools for specific, non-core tasks or components.
* **Criteria:** Human drives the core idea and execution; AI assists with specific functions.
* **Examples:** Human-written text using AI for translation/style suggestions, human-developed code using AI autocompletion, human-designed image using AI for background removal/minor changes.
* **Clarifications:** Clear distinction from AI-HR where AI generates the core output.

### 3.4 Level 2: AI-Assisted, Human-Reviewed (AI-HR)
* **Definition:** Content was generated by AI, but a human significantly reviewed, edited, fact-checked, modified, and ultimately assumes responsibility for the final output.
* **Criteria:** Substantial human intervention during and post-generation; final output is a human-validated product.
* **Examples:** AI-drafted report heavily rewritten and verified by a human expert, AI-generated image significantly altered or composited by a human artist.
* **Clarifications:** More than just prompt engineering and minor tweaks; requires meaningful human editorial control.

### 3.5 Level 3: AI-Generated, Human-Prompted (AI-HP)
* **Definition:** Content generated by AI based on human input with minimal or no subsequent human modification or validation.
* **Criteria:** Output largely reflects the AI's response to the prompt; human role is primarily initiation.
* **Examples:** Raw text output from an LLM for a given prompt, image generated via text-to-image AI used as-is or with minor cropping.
* **Clarifications:** Minimal modification is made by a human to this content excluding the initial prompt, minor tweaks to the output are acceptible. If significant editing occurs, it moves to AI-HR.

### 3.6 Level 4: Fully Automated AI (AI-FA)
* **Definition:** Content generated by AI systems operating programmatically or autonomously without direct human prompting or intervention for the specific output instance.
* **Criteria:** Generation is triggered by data feeds, schedules, or algorithms rather than specific creative prompts per output.
* **Examples:** Automated stock market summaries, templated weather reports generated from data feeds, programmatic SEO content.
* **Clarifications:** Distinction from AI-HP based on the lack of direct human prompting for each piece of content.

## 4. Applying Signum Labels

### 4.1 Principle of Primary Creation Method

To determine your contents signum label, consider the entire workflow and identify the **primary method responsible for the core output**.

**Guidance Questions:**

* **Origin:** Did the core idea, structure, and initial output originate from human effort or from an AI generation based on a prompt?
* **Output Contribution:** Which process (human work or AI generation) contributed the majority of the final content's essential information or creative elements? Refer to the definition of "Substantive Contribution" (Section 2) and the criteria within each level (Section 3).
* **Human Role:** What was the primary nature of human interaction with the content creation process?
    * Was it **minimal or indirect** (e.g., setting up an automated pipeline)? (Consider AI-FA)
    * Was it primarily **directive/initiating** (e.g., writing prompts, setting parameters for AI generation)? (Consider AI-HP)
    * Did it involve **substantive editorial review, fact-checking, or modification** of content generated by AI, taking responsibility for the final output? (Consider AI-HR)
    * Did it involve using AI tools in an **assistive** capacity to enhance primarily human-created work without generating the core substance? (Consider H-AE)
    * Was the process **reliant only on human effort** for the core creation, without substantive generative AI involvement? (Consider H)

    *(Refer to the detailed definitions and criteria in Section 3 to determine the final label based on the answers to these questions).*

* **Responsibility:** 
Who takes ultimate responsibility for the final output's integrity? Significant human review and acceptance of responsibility are hallmarks of the AI-HR level, distinguishing it from AI-HP.

The label should reflect the most accurate description of the dominant process driving the final product, guided by the detailed category definitions in Section 3.


### 4.2 Labeling Compound Content

Compound Content (defined in Section 2) consists of multiple elements potentially created using different methods (e.g., a video with human footage, AI voiceover, and human-selected music). Assigning a single label requires a consistent approach.

**Recommended Approach (Signum Standard v1.0.0): Highest Watermark Principle**

To prioritize transparency regarding *any* substantive use of generative AI, this standard recommends applying the **Highest Watermark Principle**:

* The entire piece of compound content should be assigned the Signum label corresponding to the **highest level of AI involvement present in any of its substantive components.**

**Examples:**

* A news video primarily featuring a human reporter (H) but including a 15-second AI-generated animated infographic (AI-HP) would be labeled **AI-HP**.
* A podcast episode with human hosts (H) using AI-generated transition music (AI-HP) would be labeled **AI-HP**.
* A blog post written by a human (H) but illustrated with an AI-generated image used directly from the AI tool (AI-HP) would be labeled **AI-HP**.
* A documentary film (H) using AI restoration tools to enhance old footage (non-substantive AI use, likely still H or potentially H-AE depending on the tool's nature) but also including an AI-generated voiceover for a historical figure based on a script (AI-HP) would be labeled **AI-HP**.

**Rationale:** This approach ensures that the presence of substantively AI-generated elements is always disclosed to the user, even if other parts of the content are human-generated.

*(Future versions of this standard may explore component-specific labeling for greater granularity, but v1.0.0 prioritizes a single, maximally transparent label).*


### 4.3 Labeling Modified Content

Content is often updated or modified after initial publication. The Signum label associated with the content should be reassessed and potentially updated if modifications significantly alter the balance of human vs. AI contribution or introduce generative AI substantively.

**Guidelines:**

* **Initial Label:** The label should reflect the state of the content at the time of its first labeling or publication under this standard.
* **Non-Substantive Edits:** Minor human edits (e.g., correcting typos, updating dates, minor formatting changes) generally **do not** require a change in the Signum label.
* **Substantive Human Overhaul:** If content previously labeled AI-HP or AI-FA is later *substantially* rewritten, edited, and validated by a human to the point where the human assumes responsibility for the output, the label **should be updated** (e.g., to AI-HR, or potentially H-AE if the original AI structure is almost entirely replaced).
* **Adding Substantive AI Elements:** If generative AI is used to add *new, substantive* sections or components to content previously labeled H or H-AE (e.g., adding an AI-generated chapter to a human-written report, adding AI-generated scenes to a human-shot video), the label **must be updated** according to the Highest Watermark Principle (Section 4.2). It will likely increase to AI-HR, AI-HP, or AI-FA depending on the nature of the added content and review process.
* **AI Modification of AI Content:** Using AI tools to modify content already labeled AI-HP or AI-FA generally **does not** change the label, unless significant human review and curation are introduced in the process, potentially warranting a change to AI-HR.

**Label History (Best Practice for Enhanced Transparency):**

* When the Signum label for a piece of content is updated due to modification, it is **strongly recommended** that a record of the previous label(s) and associated content version or timestamp be maintained.
* Where technically feasible, systems displaying the Signum label **should** aim to make this historical label information accessible to the user upon interaction (e.g., via tap/hover on the visual indicator).
* This provides valuable context about the content's evolution and the changing role of AI in its lifecycle.
* Implementing robust technical provenance standards, such as C2PA (Content Credentials), inherently supports the storage and retrieval of such historical metadata, making this feature more achievable. Basic implementations (e.g., simple HTML meta tags) may initially only display the current label.

**Recommendation:** Re-evaluate the Signum label whenever content undergoes significant revisions or additions, particularly if generative AI tools are involved in the modification process. Consider associating label updates with content versioning where applicable.

## 5. Technical Specification: Metadata Embedding

To ensure Signum labels can be consistently applied, read by machines, and optionally displayed by tools or platforms, this section defines recommended methods for embedding the label information as metadata. The primary goal is discoverability and interoperability.

### 5.1 Recommended Metadata Fields

The following fields, using the `signum:` namespace prefix to prevent collisions, are defined:

* **`signum:level` (Mandatory)**
    * **Description:** The Signum category label assigned to the content.
    * **Value:** MUST be one of the defined short codes: `H`, `H-AE`, `AI-HR`, `AI-HP`, `AI-FA`.
    * **Purpose:** Core identifier of the assessed AI involvement level.

* **`signum:version` (Mandatory)**
    * **Description:** The specific version number of the Signum standard document according to which the `signum:level` was determined.
    * **Value:** String representing the standard version (e.g., `"1.0.0"`). Using Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is recommended for the standard itself.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures correct interpretation of the label, as definitions or categories may evolve over time.

* **`signum:timestamp` (Mandatory)**
    * **Description:** An ISO 8601 formatted timestamp indicating when the label was assigned or when the content in this labeled state was published/created.
    * **Value:** String (e.g., `"2025-04-18T10:00:00Z"`).
    * **Purpose:** Provides temporal context for the label assignment and aids in tracking provenance history.

* **`signum:tool` (Optional)**
    * **Description:** An identifier for the primary generative AI tool(s) or model(s) used in the creation process (relevant for levels H-AE, AI-HR, AI-HP, AI-FA). Disclosure is subject to creator/platform policy.
    * **Value:** Array (e.g., `["ChatGPT 4.0", "Midjourney v7.1", "Internal Model 'Phoenix'"]`). Could be a name, version, or URI.
    * **Purpose:** Adds granularity for users or systems interested in the specific AI technology employed.

* **`signum:asserter` (Required)**
    * **Description:** An identifier (e.g., URI, domain name, organizational ID, Social media handle) for the entity (creator, publisher, platform) making the assertion about the Signum level.
    * **Value:** String (URI recommended, e.g., `"https://example.com/about#publishing-entity"`, Handles can be used such as:
    ```
    handle:<platform_id>:<handle> 
    "handle:x:@SignumProject", "handle:instagram:creator_xyz
    ```
    * **Purpose:** Increases accountability, especially useful when labels are self-declared.

* **`signum:history` (Optional - for Enhanced Transparency)**
    * **Description:** Provides access to the history of Signum labels for previous versions of the content, as recommended in Section 4.3.
    * **Value:** Could be a URL pointing to a history record/API endpoint, or potentially an embedded structured data representation (e.g., a JSON array string) defining previous labels, versions, and timestamps. The exact format for embedded history may be defined in future standard versions.
    * **Purpose:** Supports the display of label evolution upon user interaction.

### 5.2 Implementation: HTML Meta Tags

For web content, Signum labels can be embedded using standard `<meta>` tags within the document's `<head>` section. This method is simple and widely compatible.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="signum:level" content="AI-HR">
  <meta name="signum:version" content="1.0.0">
  <meta name="signum:timestamp" content="2025-04-18T00:10:27Z">
  <meta name="signum:tool" content="Tool A; Tool B">
  <meta name="signum:asserter" content="[https://example.com](https://example.com)">
  <meta name="signum:history" content="[https://example.com/content/article-123/signum-history](https://example.com/content/article-123/signum-history)">
</head>
```

### 5.3 Implementation: JSON-LD
* Provide example schema for embedding Signum data within a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block.
```
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "[https://schema.org](https://schema.org)",
  "@type": "NewsArticle", // Or other relevant Schema.org type
  "headline": "Example Article Title",
  // ... other Schema.org properties ...

  // Embedding Signum data as a structured object
  "identifier": [ // Or potentially using usageInfo, creativeWorkStatus, or custom property
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "propertyID": "signum:provenance", // Grouping Signum info
      "value": {
        "@type": "CreativeWork", // Or a custom type like "SignumProvenanceInfo"
        "signum:level": "AI-HR",
        "signum:version": "1.0.0",
        "signum:timestamp": "2025-04-18T00:10:27Z",
        "signum:tool": "Tool A; Tool B",
        "signum:asserter": "[https://example.com](https://example.com)",
        "signum:history": {
             "@type": "WebPage", // Link to a page with history
             "url": "[https://example.com/content/article-123/signum-history](https://example.com/content/article-123/signum-history)"
         }
        // Alternatively, history could be an embedded array if desired
        // "signum:history": [
        //   { "level": "AI-HP", "version": "1.0.0", "timestamp": "2025-04-17T15:00:00Z" }, ...
        // ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

### 5.4 Implementation: Markdown Documents (.md)

Applying Signum labels to Markdown content requires conventions that provide both machine-readability for processing systems and clear indicators for human readers.

**Primary Method: YAML Front Matter**

* **Recommendation:** The **preferred method** for embedding Signum metadata in Markdown files is **YAML Front Matter**. This involves including a YAML block enclosed by triple-dashed lines (`---`) at the very beginning of the file.
* **Rationale:** This is a widely recognized convention for metadata in Markdown, easily parsed by static site generators, documentation tools, and other processors. It cleanly separates metadata from the main content.
* **Structure:** Define the Signum fields within a `signum:` key. *(Referencing the structure defined in Section 5.1)*.
* **Example:**
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Signum Project README
  date: 2025-04-18
  signum:
    level: H-AE          # Mandatory
    version: "1.0.0"     # Mandatory
    timestamp: "2025-04-18T18:30:00Z" # Mandatory
    asserter: "uri:[https://github.com/your-org](https://github.com/your-org)" # Mandatory
    tool: ["AI Spellchecker Pro"] # Optional
  ---


  Regular Markdown content begins here..

### 5.5 File-Level Metadata Embedding & C2PA Alignment

Ensuring Signum labels persist when content is downloaded, shared, or used offline requires embedding information **within the file's metadata**. This is crucial for media files like images (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF), video (MP4), audio (MP3), and documents (PDF).

The landscape for standardized provenance metadata is evolving rapidly. The Signum standard recommends the following approach for file-level embedding:

* **Primary Recommendation: C2PA (Content Credentials)**
    * The **strongly recommended** and most robust mechanism for embedding Signum provenance data into supported file types is the **C2PA (Content Credentials)** standard ([https://c2pa.org/](https://c2pa.org/)).
    * **Rationale:** C2PA is an open technical standard specifically designed to provide tamper-evident, verifiable provenance for digital media. It uses cryptographically signed manifests embedded within files to record details about asset creation and modification history. C2PA has broad industry support (including major software vendors, platforms, camera manufacturers, and news organizations) and is designed to resist metadata stripping.
    * **Signum & C2PA Integration:** The Signum project aims for full alignment with C2PA. The Signum fields (`signum:level`, `signum:version`, `signum:timestamp`, `signum:asserter`, `signum:tool`, `signum:history`) should be represented as defined **C2PA Assertions** within a C2PA Manifest. *(A companion document or future version of this standard will provide the precise mapping and assertion definitions for C2PA integration).* Tools and platforms implementing Signum are encouraged to adopt C2PA for embedding this data.

* **Alternative/Fallback: XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform)**
    * Where C2PA implementation is not yet available or feasible within a specific workflow, embedding Signum data using **XMP** is a recognized alternative.
    * **Rationale:** XMP is a well-established ISO standard for creating, processing, and interchanging structured metadata, widely supported by creative tools (e.g., Adobe products) and digital asset management systems.
    * **Implementation:** A specific **Signum XMP schema** should be used, utilizing the `signum:` namespace prefix (e.g., `<signum:Level>`, `<signum:Version>`). *(The detailed XMP schema definition will be provided in an appendix or companion document).*
    * **Limitations:** While structured, standard XMP data does not offer the cryptographic security or tamper-evidence of C2PA and is more susceptible to being stripped by downstream platforms or simpler editing tools.

* **Discouraged Methods:**
    * The use of unstructured EXIF UserComment fields or the repurposing of unrelated IPTC metadata fields for storing Signum labels is **strongly discouraged**. These methods lack standardization, semantic meaning for this purpose, and are highly unreliable due to frequent stripping and potential misinterpretation.

**Future Considerations:**

* The Signum project will actively work on publishing the formal C2PA assertion definitions and the Signum XMP schema.
* Guidance for embedding Signum data in specific file formats beyond those currently well-supported by C2PA or XMP (e.g., certain audio or video codecs, specific document formats) may be addressed in future versions or extensions of this standard.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize C2PA for robust, verifiable, and persistent Signum labeling in files. Use the defined Signum XMP schema as a structured fallback where necessary. Avoid non-standardized metadata fields.

While the core of the Signum standard lies in the defined categories (Section 3) and embedded metadata (Section 5), visual indicators provide immediate cues to human users. This section outlines the standard visual elements and provides guidance on their display.

### 6.1 Standard Codes

The following short codes are the standardized textual representation for each Signum level:

* **H** (Level 0: Human)
* **H-AE** (Level 1: Human, AI-Enhanced)
* **AI-HR** (Level 2: AI-Assisted, Human-Reviewed)
* **AI-HP** (Level 3: AI-Generated, Human-Prompted)
* **AI-FA** (Level 4: Fully Automated AI)

These codes may be used directly as simple text labels or in conjunction with icons.

### 6.2 Standard Icons

A set of official Signum icons is provided to visually represent each level.

* **Source:** The official icons are available in SVG format within the Signum project repository: [`/assets/icons`](./assets/icons) ( *Note: Adjust link if needed* ).
* **Design Principles:** Icons are designed to be simple, clearly distinguishable even at small sizes, and visually represent the balance of human and AI involvement.
* **Icons Overview:** *(Placeholder: Include either textual descriptions or small embedded images/links to the icons here once designed)*
    * `H`: [Icon representing Human creation]
    * `H-AE`: [Icon representing Human creation with minor AI assistance]
    * `AI-HR`: [Icon representing AI creation with significant Human review/control]
    * `AI-HP`: [Icon representing AI creation prompted by Human]
    * `AI-FA`: [Icon representing Automated AI creation]
* **Color:** The standard icons are primarily provided in monochrome (e.g., black or white) to allow flexible application across different backgrounds and designs. A recommended optional color palette may be provided in a separate style guide, but **color alone MUST NOT be used** to convey the Signum level due to accessibility reasons.
* **License:** The standard Signum icons are provided under the project's open-source license (e.g., MIT License).

### 6.3 Display Recommendations

Consistency and clarity are key when displaying Signum labels visually.

* **Consistency:** Use the official standard icon or code for the corresponding level consistently. Avoid creating custom visuals that could cause confusion.
* **Placement:**
    * **Web/Documents:** Recommended placement is in a consistent location, such as the top-right or top-left corner of the main content area, or adjacent to the primary headline, author byline, or publication date.
    * **Short-Form/Social Media:** Consistent corner overlay (e.g., top-right) or integration into the platform's UI chrome near the username/caption area is recommended.
    * **Images (if applied visually):** Consistent corner (e.g., bottom-right).
* **Size:** Indicators should be easily noticeable but not overly intrusive. A default size rendering equivalent to approximately 16px to 24px height for icons is often appropriate, but context may require adjustments. Ensure legibility for text codes.
* **Interaction (Highly Recommended):**
    * Visual indicators **SHOULD** be interactive where technically feasible (e.g., on web platforms).
    * On hover or tap, the indicator **SHOULD** reveal more detailed information. At minimum, this includes the full Signum level name (e.g., "Level 2: AI-Assisted, Human-Reviewed") and the Signum standard version (e.g., "v1.0.0").
    * Ideally, the interaction **SHOULD** display all available embedded Signum metadata fields (`asserter`, `timestamp`, `tool`, and a link to or representation of `history` if available). Tooltips, pop-overs, or dedicated information panels can be used.
* **Accessibility:** Visual indicators **MUST** be implemented accessibly:
    * **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between the indicator and its background, adhering to WCAG guidelines.
    * **Alt Text:** `<img>` elements or CSS background images used for icons MUST include descriptive alternative text (e.g., `alt="Signum Label: AI-Generated, Human-Prompted"`).
    * **Screen Readers:** Interactive elements must be keyboard-focusable and provide accessible names/descriptions (e.g., via `aria-label` or visually hidden text) that communicate the label information to screen reader users.
    * **Color Independence:** Do not rely solely on color to differentiate levels. The icon shapes or text codes must be the primary identifiers.

### 6.4 Visuals Driven by Metadata

As outlined in Section 5, the displayed visual indicator should ideally be determined by the authoritative Signum metadata embedded within the content or its associated data structures (e.g., YAML Front Matter, C2PA Manifest, XMP).

* **Recommendation:** Systems processing content with embedded Signum metadata **SHOULD** automatically render the correct standard visual indicator based on the `signum:level` found in the metadata.
* **Benefit:** This ensures consistency, reduces the chance of manual error, and reinforces the metadata as the single source of truth.

### 6.5 Contextual Considerations

* **Images:** Applying visual indicators directly onto image pixels is optional (Section 5.4). If done, the indicator MUST match the embedded metadata. This is most useful when metadata stripping is likely.
* **Markdown/Text:** Visual display primarily relies on rendering engines interpreting embedded metadata (e.g., YAML, Section 5.5). A simple text mention is an optional fallback for raw views.
* **Audio/Video:** Metadata embedding (ideally C2PA) is the most robust method. Visual display depends on the player application or platform UI. Players **SHOULD** be developed to read Signum metadata and display the information (visually or textually) in a consistent manner (e.g., as an overlay during playback, or within the info panel).


## 7. Relationship to Other Standards & Policies

### 7.1 C2PA (Content Credentials)
* Explain how Signum labels can complement C2PA data – potentially by being included *within* C2PA manifests in the future, or used alongside.

### 7.2 Platform-Specific Labeling
* Acknowledge platform requirements (Meta, Google, etc.) and position Signum as a potential underlying standard they could adopt or map to for consistency.

## 8. Standard Evolution & Governance

### 8.1 Versioning Scheme
* Specify Semantic Versioning (SemVer) or similar.

### 8.2 Proposal Process
* Outline how changes or additions to the standard can be proposed, discussed, and adopted (e.g., via GitHub Issues/Pull Requests, community consensus).

## 9. Appendices

### 9.1 Appendix A: Detailed Examples & Edge Cases
* Provide more complex scenarios and how they should be labeled according to the standard.
