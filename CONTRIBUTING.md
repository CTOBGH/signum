Thanks for considering contributing to Signum! We truly appreciate your interest and effort. 

This document provides guidelines to help you contribute effectively.

## Code of Conduct

The Signum project is committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community. All participants are expected to adhere to our **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please read it before participating. 

## How You Can Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Signum's development and adoption:

* **Report Bugs:** Identify and report issues in the standard's definition, documentation, code examples, or supporting libraries (CSS, JS, etc.).
* **Suggest Enhancements:** Propose improvements to the standard, documentation clarity, usability, or new features for supporting tools.
* **Propose Standard Changes:** Suggest modifications, clarifications, or additions to the `STANDARD.md` itself (please expect thorough discussion for standard changes).
* **Improve Documentation:** Help make the `STANDARD.md`, `USAGE.md`, code docstrings, and other documentation clearer, more accurate, and more comprehensive. Correct typos and grammatical errors.
* **Submit Code:** Contribute to the development of official Signum libraries (`signum-css`, `signum-js`, future packages) by fixing bugs or adding features.
* **Add Examples:** Contribute real-world or illustrative examples to Appendix of the `STANDARD.md` or the `USAGE.md`.
* **Refine Visual Assets:** Help design, refine, or provide feedback on the standard Signum icons.
* **Provide Feedback:** Share your experience using Signum â€“ what works well, what's confusing, where are the pain points?

## Getting Started

1.  **Familiarise Yourself:** Read the core project documents:
    * [README.md](README.md) (Project overview and vision)
    * [STANDARD.md](STANDARD.md) (The definitive specification)
    * [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) (Practical guide for applying labels)
2.  **Check Existing Issues & Discussions:** Look through the [GitHub Issues][Link to Issues] and [GitHub Discussions][Link to Discussions] (if enabled) to see if your bug report or idea has already been submitted or discussed.
3.  **Find Your Niche:** Decide how you'd like to contribute based on the list above.

## Contribution Workflow

Please follow these workflows for different types of contributions:

### Reporting Bugs

1.  **Search:** Check the [GitHub Issues][Link to Issues] to ensure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2.  **Open Issue:** If it's a new bug, open a new issue. Use the "Bug Report" template if available.
3.  **Details:** Provide as much detail as possible:
    * A clear and descriptive title.
    * Steps to accurately reproduce the bug.
    * What you expected to happen.
    * What actually happened (screenshots, error messages are helpful).
    * Your environment (e.g., browser version, OS, library version) if relevant.

### Suggesting Enhancements or Standard Changes

1.  **Search:** Check [GitHub Issues][Link to Issues] and [Discussions][Link to Discussions] for existing related suggestions.
2.  **Open Issue:** If your idea is new, open a new issue. Use the "Feature Request" or "Standard Proposal" template if available.
3.  **Explain:** Clearly describe your suggestion:
    * A clear and descriptive title.
    * The problem your proposal solves or the enhancement it provides.
    * Your proposed solution or idea in as much detail as possible.
    * Any potential benefits or drawbacks you foresee.
4.  **Discuss:** Be prepared for discussion in the issue thread. Significant changes, especially to the `STANDARD.md`, will require community feedback and maintainer consensus before implementation work begins.

### Submitting Pull Requests (Code, Documentation, Assets)

We actively welcome Pull Requests (PRs)!

1.  **Issue Association:** Ideally, ensure there's an associated Issue discussing the bug fix or feature before starting work on a PR, especially for larger changes. You can create one if needed. Link your PR to the relevant issue (e.g., "Fixes #123").
2.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork the main Signum repository to your own GitHub account, then clone your fork locally.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/signum.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/signum.git)
    cd signum
    ```
3.  **Create Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes, based off the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-jsonld-parser`, `fix/readme-typo`, `docs/clarify-level-h`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Make Changes:** Implement your code, documentation, or asset changes locally.
5.  **Add Tests:** If you are contributing code, please include relevant unit tests or integration tests. Ensure existing tests pass.
6.  **Follow Style Guides:** Adhere to any project style guides (see section below). Ensure code is linted if linters are configured.
7.  **Commit Changes:** Make clear, logical commits. Write informative commit messages. We recommend following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, but it's not strictly enforced initially.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add JSON-LD parsing function"
    ```
8.  **Push Branch:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
9.  **Open Pull Request:** Navigate to the main Signum repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch (`YOUR_USERNAME/signum/feature/your-feature-name`) to the main Signum repository's `main` branch.
10. **Describe PR:** Fill out the PR template if provided. Clearly explain the changes made, the reasoning behind them, and link the associated Issue.
11. **Review & Iterate:** Project maintainers will review your PR. Address any feedback or requested changes promptly. Further discussion might happen on the PR thread. Once approved, your contribution will be merged!

## Communication Channels

* **[GitHub Issues][Link to Issues]:** Best for specific bug reports and feature/standard proposals.
* **[GitHub Discussions][Link to Discussions]:** Best for general questions, broader ideas, community chat, and showcasing uses of Signum (Use the "Show and tell" category!).
